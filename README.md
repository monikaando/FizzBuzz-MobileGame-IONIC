# IONIC - mobile application
FizzyBuzz Game with winners' image gallery.
# My solution

## Provide one or multiple examples of code that you’re proud of and explain why.  
- easy implementation FizzBuzz game from the previous module to IONIC environment
- gallery working with camera plugin
- styling

## If you can, provide some examples of code that you’re not proud of and explain why.
Sometimes when I upload a game to IOS it won't save the first picture immediately. I can see this picture after I restart the app. It is not happening every time.

## What are some ways you would like to improve the application if you had time?
- better alert window
- not using correctAnswer function

## What issues did you run into and how did you solve them?
### Issue: I was testing the app with my friends, 98% of them didn't want to read the instructions.

I provided the most important rules right before game start.
### Issue: In the end of building application the simulator for android updated. I had problem with the simulator from the beginning (didn't read the whole page) but after was even worse(randomly appearing errors: double screen, super slow work, crashing, showing the half of the screen, after a time it didn't create a gallery of pictures anymore, and I didn't change anything in the code.)

I was checking both systems in the Xcode simulator in the same time (android and IOS) + IOS on my iphone. Testing with IOS went fine, the same effect as with Android before updating the simulator. Unfortunately I have no Android phone to test.
